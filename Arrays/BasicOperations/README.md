# Arrays Basic Operations

Following are the main basic operations supported by an array:

1 - Traverse: Print all the array elements.

2 - Insertion: Adds an element at the given index and reorganize the array. In this operation, the last element of the array will be lost, since the number of elements is fixed

3 - Deletion: Deletes an element at the given index and reorganize the array. In this operation, the last element of the array will be empty.

4 - Update: Updates an element at the given index.

The second and third operations are slow due to the characteristics of this structure.
